Back in 2014 I joined BatCat games in Dublin to create OniKira Demon Killer, a 2d hack n' slash action game in the vein of Devil May Cry and God of War.
I originally joined the team as a level designer but as production continued I took on more responsibility as a programmer, scripting gameplay events, cutscenes, boss battles and creating numerous tools to improve the workflow of myself and the team.

We released OniKira on Steam in August 2015.

- Designed mechanical and visual elements across all game levels
- Developed tools and procedural assets to improve workflow
