My names Ronan. I'm a recently graduated web developer based just outside Dublin, Ireland. My primary focus right now is on frontend development, I'm neck deep in Javascript and ReactJS these days and loving every minute of it.

Previously I've worked as a game developer for a small indie games studio and as a architectural 3D artist. I'm always looking to find a balance between the technical and the creative.

As for this site, I'll be posting tid-bits about the projects I'm working on. Expect some web stuff, some Unreal Engine games stuff and maybe some music stuff (I'm also an avid bass player).

Thanks for visiting
