My names Ronan. I'm a junior web developer based Kildare, Ireland. My primary focus right now is on frontend development, I spend a lot of time building web and mobile apps in React and React Native.

Previously I've worked as a game developer for a small indie games studio and as a architectural 3D artist. I'm always looking to find a balance between the technical and the creative.

Thanks for visiting
